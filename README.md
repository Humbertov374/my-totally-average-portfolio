# my-totally-average-portfolio
For this week's challenge we start our portfolio! We will be using in the past 2 weeks to make a dynamic and original portfolio showcasing ourselves and our work. With challenge we start off with a simple index.html and style.css file to set the bones and looks of our portfolio. After creating the "skeletal" part of our portfolio, we then shift to the more technical aspects such as, responsive buttons, flexbot placement, and much more!
